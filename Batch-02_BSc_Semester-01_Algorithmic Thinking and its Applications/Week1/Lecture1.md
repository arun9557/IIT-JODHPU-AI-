## 🧩 Basic Concepts Introduction

1. **Basics of thinking:**  
   How to think like a computer scientist.

2. **What are problems?**  
   Understanding the structure and components of a problem.

3. **How to solve problems using algorithms:**  
   Breaking down the solution into logical steps.

4. **Flow charts:**  
   Visual representation of step-by-step logic.

5. **What is Computer Science?**  
   > “I'm pretty new to computer science. I don't even know how to use a computer.”  
   → This course is for absolute beginners too.

## 📝 Key Concepts (Deep Dive)

### 🔹 Break your problem into a **sequence of steps**  
> A "fancy term" for this is **algorithm**, and in structured form, it's **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**.

### ❓ Questions We Explored

#### 🧩 *What are problems?*
- A **task**, a **question**, or a **situation** needing a solution.

#### 🧩 *How to identify a problem?*
1. You move to a **new city**, want to settle down.
2. Define your **constraints**:
   - 💰 Budget  
   - ⏱️ Time  
   - 🧰 Resources  
   - 📍 Location (e.g., "My house should be near my workplace")

> "To define a problem meaningfully, break it into **sub-problems**."
