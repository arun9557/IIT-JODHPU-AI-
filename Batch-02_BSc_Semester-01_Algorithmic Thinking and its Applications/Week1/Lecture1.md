🧠 Conceptual Topics Covered

What is Algorithmic Thinking?
A systematic way to solve problems by breaking them into smaller, logical steps.


How to Think Like a Computer Scientist?
Focus on identifying problems, defining constraints, and solving them step-by-step.


What are Problems?
Tasks, situations, or challenges that require a solution (e.g., settling in a new city).


What are Algorithms?
A sequence of steps to solve a problem, often represented as flowcharts or code (leads to DSA: Data Structures & Algorithms).




🧩 Key Concepts (Deep Dive)
🔹 What is a Problem?

A task, situation, or challenge needing a solution.
Examples:
Mathematical problems (e.g., find X where X ≤ 10).
Real-life problems (e.g., settling in a new city with a budget).



🔹 How to Identify a Problem?

Define the Problem Clearly:
Example: "I moved to a new city and need to settle down."


Identify Constraints:
Constraints are limits or conditions affecting the solution.
Example:
💰 Budget: Can I rent or buy?
📍 Location: Is the house near my workplace?
🛡️ Safety: Are hospitals or schools nearby?
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Strength: Am I moving alone or with family?




Prioritize Constraints:
Not all constraints are equally important. Assign weights based on priorities.
Example: If budget is high, location or facilities may matter less.



🔹 How to Solve a Problem?

Break it into Sub-Problems:
Split the big problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
Example: To get to college → Wake up → Get ready → Eat breakfast → Catch bus → Arrive.


Use Flowcharts:
Visualize the sequence of steps to solve sub-problems (covered in next lecture).


Apply Constraints:
Example: If you have less money, take a bus instead of a cab.


Write It Down:
Documenting the problem and steps helps clarify the solution.




Fancy Term: This process is called an algorithm. In coding, it’s the foundation of DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).


🛠 Practical Tips for Beginners

No Prior Knowledge Needed: This course starts from zero, even for those new to computers.
Python Basics: We’ll learn Python programming to solve real-life problems.
Troubleshooting:
Common Python errors:
SyntaxError: Check for missing colons (:) or incorrect indentation.
NameError: Ensure variable names are defined before use.


Always test code step-by-step.


LMS Queries: Post logistics-related doubts (e.g., attendance, account issues) on the LMS, not via personal messages.


🛠️ Example: Real-Life Problem
Problem: You move to a new city and want to settle down.

Sub-Problems:
Find a house.
Arrange logistics (e.g., transport, utilities).
Ensure proximity to workplace/school/hospital.


Constraints:
Budget (rent vs. buy).
Family size (alone or with kids).
Location (near office or school).


Solution Approach:
List constraints and prioritize (e.g., budget > location).
Break into steps: Search for houses → Compare options → Finalize.
Use a flowchart to visualize (to be covered next lecture).




📝 Code Snippet (Placeholder)
To be added in future lectures when Python is introduced.Example (basic Python for beginners):
# Greet the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Algorithmic Thinking!")


✅ End Note

“You don’t need to be an expert. Just be curious, write down problems, and break them into steps. You’re halfway there!”
